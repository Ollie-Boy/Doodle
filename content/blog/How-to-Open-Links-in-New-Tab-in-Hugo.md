I wanted hugo to open external links in new tabs but after several trials, I failed. What I tried are:
1. HTML
```html
<a href="https://example.com/" target="_blank">This is an example!</a>
```
2. kramdown syntax
```markdown
[Example](https://www.example.com){:target="_blank"}
```
After that I was like:
>Bruh, what happened?!!

**Update:** You can simply set `[markup.goldmark.renderer.unsafe] = true` in your `config.toml`, then go to 1.

{{< highlight toml "hl_lines=5" >}}
# This is the default configuration for the Goldmark Markdown renderer:
[markup]
  [markup.goldmark]
    [markup.goldmark.renderer]
      unsafe = true
{{< / highlight >}}

And then, I find [this](https://discourse.gohugo.io/t/how-to-open-link-in-new-tab-with-hugos-new-goldmark-markdown-renderer-in-v0-62-0/22540) which saves my life.
I'll just show how to do it directly, you can go to learn more if you have interest.

1. Create `render-link.html` in `../layouts/_default/_markup`.

2. Copy and paste.
```go
{{/*  To tell hugo to open links in a new tab and do not let the site you are linking to to know the traffic came from your site  */}}
<a href="{{ .Destination | safeURL }}"{{ with .Title}} title="{{ . }}"{{ end }}{{ if strings.HasPrefix .Destination "http" }} target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"{{ end }}>
    {{ .Text }}
  </a>
```
All finished, just build your site and enjoy.
